  "description": "The static analysis subsystem is responsible for ingesting source code, analyzing its structure, and resolving references within the codebase. The Scanner component initiates the analysis by parsing code and generating an initial understanding of the project's languages and file types. For TypeScript and JavaScript projects, the TypeScript Client interacts with an external Language Server Protocol (LSP) server to obtain rich semantic information, which is crucial for deep code understanding. The TypeScript Config Scanner plays a vital role in this process by identifying and interpreting TypeScript configuration files, providing essential context for the TypeScript Client's operations. The Reference Resolution Mixin provides the core functionality for resolving code references across different languages, enabling the system to trace definitions, usages, and call hierarchies. Finally, VSCode Constants provides configuration parameters and definitions relevant to the VS Code environment, indicating the system's integration with or dependency on the VS Code ecosystem. This architecture allows for a flexible and extensible static analysis pipeline that can adapt to various programming languages and project configurations.",
