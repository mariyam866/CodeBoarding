  "description": "The system operates around an Orchestration Engine that manages the entire documentation generation pipeline. It initiates the process by leveraging the Project Scanner to gather static analysis data, which is then stored in Static Analysis Results. The Orchestration Engine then coordinates a suite of AI Agents, each with specialized roles, to analyze this data. These agents utilize a sophisticated Prompt Factory to construct dynamic prompts for the LLM, enabling both \"bidirectional\" and \"unidirectional\" communication patterns. Agent responses are processed by the Agent Response Processor before being fed back to the Orchestration Engine for further coordination, feedback application, and final result saving. This architecture emphasizes a modular, agent-based approach with a highly adaptable prompting mechanism for intelligent code analysis and documentation generation.",
